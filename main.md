# Introduction

The intro goes here. We can cite existing work [@lamport_time_1978]

# Background

Then some background so that people can understand

# Details

The architecture of the system:

![Our system is fairly simple.](figures/square.png)

And a table listing some things:

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines.

Then some details. With some cpp code:

```cpp
#include <iostream.h>

main()
{
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
