# Introduction

The intro goes here. We can cite existing work [@lamport_time_1978] 
and some more [@gray_granularity_1976 ; @lampson_how_1996 ; 
@stonebraker_readings_1988].

The article can also include [links to pages](http://wikipedia.org). 
We can also refer to other sections, for example, [see\ ](#bg).

# Background {#bg}

Then some background so that people can understand

# Our System

The architecture of the system can be seen below (Figure 1).

![Our system is fairly simple. It consists of a single 
rectangle](figures/square.png)

## The high-level features

The article can also include tables. A table might contain and be 
formatted in different ways (see Table 1).

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |

Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines.

## The Details

Then some details. With some cpp code:

```cpp
#include <iostream.h>

main()
{
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

We can also use footnotes[^footnote].

[^footnote]: This footnote is for illustration purposes only, don't 
take it too seriously.
