# Docker- and Pandoc-based Template for Academic Articles

The goal of this project is to expedite the generation of academic 
articles. Pandoc is a _swiss army knife_ of document generation, it's 
main goal is to separate content from presentation. The `main.md` file 
is a very simple example of a format-agnostic article. The `demos` 
folder contains a list of bash scripts that show how to produce 
articles in distinct formats. Take a look at the 
[README](demos/README.md) for more.
