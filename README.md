# Academic articles template

The goal of this project is to expedite the generation of academic 
articles. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) is a _swiss army knife_ of 
document generation, its main goal is to separate content from 
presentation. [Docker](http://docker.io) solves the "dependency hell" 
problem. The two combined makes for a great productivity tool.

The `main.md` file is a very simple example of a format-agnostic 
article. The `demos` folder contains a list of bash scripts that show 
how to generate format-specific documents. Take a look at the 
[README](demos/README.md) for more.
